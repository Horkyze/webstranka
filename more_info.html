	<strong>Policy Statements:</strong></p>
<p>
	The deadline for delivering your Policy Statements is on the 30th of October. Each delegate is supposed to write one statement for his/her committee, and each delegation is required to prepare one for the General Assembly together. You will be contacted by your Chairpersons. For more information and tips on how to write a policy statement, please refer to article &quot;How to Write a Policy Statement&quot; on pages 27, 28 and 28 of BratMUN: The Complete Guide publication. We have to apologize for providing the information this late and trust that preparing your Policy Statements at such a short notice will not affect their quality.</p>

	Men should wear a (lounge) suit, or trousers (not jeans) with a jacket, a shirt and a tie. Formal shoes (not trainers) must be worn.</p>

	Women should wear a suit comprising a suit jacket and trousers or a skirt with a blouse or a sweater. Dress shoes must be worn.</p>
