<tr><td>Question : </td><td>Do you find the revolution in Egypt to be succesfull after Hosni Mubarak has been thrown down? What are the biggest risks when a military council is running the country?</td></tr>
<tr><td>Answer :</td><td>I find that the revolution in Egypt has not been very successfull after Hosni Mubarak has been thrown down, as many of the other original aims of the protesters were ignored. 
One of that aims was to decrease levels of corruption. As the cabinet appointed by Mubarak is still ruling and has not undergone large changes, I suspect that a large number of Mubarak loyalists are still in power and so subject to corruption. 
Another problem in Egypt are high levels of unemployment and low salaries. Before Mubarak resigned, the cabinet accepted a 15% payrise for state workers, but I have not registered much progress afterwards, even though the police and ambulance drivers have gone on strike several times. 
Random police brutality was also one of the reasons for the revolution beginning. There have been reports of 4 people dying under the hands of police men in the course of three weeks, and other two being shot. This could lead to a reignition of the waves of strikes that have swept accross Egypt. 

One of the main risks of having a military council running the country is that there is a very faint anf fragile boundary between a democracy and a military dictatorship. Police and army interference could be seen as a neccesity by the state, while citizens could see it as brutality. This could be a cause for more riots and the whole string of events could repeat itself. 
Until now, the military council has shown an inability to change the laws in the subjects of political and economical reforms, and even human rights and freedom of expression. This is shown in a testimony of one woman, who, after participating in a street protest, had to undergo a \'Virginity test\', and in the course of it was forced to let herself be examined, naked, by men. The problem is that under a military rule this could be seen as being right, since it is making sure that there is no criminality (prostitution charges can be held). 

In general, I do not think that the revolution has been successfull. Even though Hosni Mubarak is not in power anymore and certain by him appointed ministers have travel bans, the new goverment is still full of people loyal to Mubarak, and even worse, new fundamentalists can try to take over.
